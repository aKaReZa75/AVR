# Videos
  This document provides a concise summary of the educational videos on AVR microcontrollers. It includes key points, sample codes, and header files from those sections.     
   - For example, if the video explains setting up an 8-bit timer in CTC mode and mentions that the process is similar for 16-bit timers, this document complements the videos by also providing setup examples for 16-bit timers in CTC mode.
